# Design

Below is a wireframe of the website. There are 3 main sections: the
_**header**_, which contains the title and navigation bar; the _**main
section**_ with text, images, and a sidebar; and the _**footer**_, which has the
links for contacting the authors.

- Red elements - **must-haves**
- Green elements - **should-haves**
- Blue elements - **could-haves**
